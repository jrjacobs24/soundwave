== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Google Adsense plugin installed, but it does not appear in the list of plugins in the Wordpress admin dashboard. Why? =

It is possible that you have AdBlock browser extension (or similar software) installed in your browser and it blocks ads. Disable AdBlock extension to see the Adsense plugin and make necessary changes.

= Adsense plugin doesn't work (ads not displaying). What should I do? =

Please complete the following steps:
1. Setup your Google Adsense account.
2. Make sure that your Wordpress theme contains necessary hooks for ads displaying (the_content, wp_footer, etc). If you don't know how to check that, just install any official Wordpress theme (for example, [Twenty Sixteen](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentysixteen/)) and check if the ads are displayed. If yes, it means that the necessary hooks are missing in your theme.
3. Make sure Adblock (or similar browser extensions) is disabled in your browser.

= How to add Google Adsense block to the sidebar? =

Follow the next steps in order to add the Google Adsense block to the sidebar:
1. Open your Wordpress admin dashboard.
2. Make sure that Google Adsense plugin is installed and activated.
3. Navigate to the Appearance > Widgets section and add the Google Adsense widget to the available sidebar.

= How do I see my reporting/stats? Will it show up on my Google Adsense account? When? =

If everything is correct, you will see it in your Google Adsense account.

= I have some problems with the plugin's work. What Information should I provide to receive proper support? =

Please provide the following data along with your problem's description to support@gasplugin.com:
